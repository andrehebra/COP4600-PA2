//UPDATED TODO:
//Make the Hash Map work properly -> //Choose Which InserNode Function To Implement In 
//dbase.c (insertBeginNode) or (insertEndNode)
//Conditional Variables
//Locking Mechanism
//Refining-Debugging Sample Output

HOW TO/ WHEN RUNNING:
//to compile just type "make" in the terminal to create the .exe
// to run type "./myprogram" -> if you change this please let us know
//type "make clean" after every exe to refresh, was getting errors becasue it wasn't updating properly

Work On Main (gcc main.c)

//I've Already Connected All The C Files Together - Ayman
//Fixed Timestamp To Output As Milliseconds


//The makefile should be working - Devin
//got it to read input properly, should be able to debug single-threadedly?
//It should reach all functions across every file
//it got to create record with one input
//moved the Timestamp func to parse file
